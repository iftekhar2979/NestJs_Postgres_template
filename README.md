## Migration

_**Avoid synchronizing with the database for every DB change, instead use a migration system to prevent loss of data or any unwanted behavior**_

1. Perform any schema change in any entity file
2. Run command `npm run migration:generate` to generate a new migration file with changes from your entities
3. Run `npm run migration:run` to apply OR restart the app to run the migration automatically and watch the change in database
